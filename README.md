## Git Branches 

### Main 
This is the branch we built in class.  It has all of the functionality.  It also has a Teacher Resource folder that covers the competencies of this lesson and some ideas on ordering the teaching of this lesson. 

### Detailed_Comments 
This branch is the same files but with a bunch of extra comments going over every part of the app. 

## Resources you can use for this project 

### Xcode 
We used Xcode 15 on this lesson.  

### ChatGPT 
We used chatGPT to create mock data.  This can let us put more focus on building the structure of the app and save us time in having the students think up random names. 

### Mentimeter 
This online tool allows us to submit ideas as a group.  Other options are using giant paper that you can tape to the walls.  Then students can walk around and choose the best 3 properties.  

### Draw.io 
This online tool allows you to build UML Diagrams that can be stored in Google Drive for later use.
